To create your own shortcodes in Hugo, add an HTML file in layouts/shortcodes/. This theme provides the following useful custom shortcodes: 


### Info card

Displays information in a card format.

##### Shortcode
```
{{/* < info_cards header="lorem-ipsum" title="What is Lorem Ipsum?" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry." > */}}
```

##### Output
{{< info_cards header="lorem-ipsum" title="What is Lorem Ipsum?" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.">}}

{{< info_cards role="success" header="lorem-ipsum" title="What is Lorem Ipsum?" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.">}}


{{< info_cards role="warning" header="lorem-ipsum" title="What is Lorem Ipsum?" content="Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.">}}

### Details

This simply adds the html5 detail attribute, supported on all *modern* browsers. Use it like this:

##### Shortcode
```
{{/* < details "This is the details title (click to expand)" > */ }}
Some placeholder content for the collapse component. This panel is hidden by default but revealed when the user activates the relevant trigger.
{{ /* < /details > */}}
```

##### Output
{{< details "This is the details title (click to expand)" >}}
Some placeholder content for the collapse component. This panel is hidden by default but revealed when the user activates the relevant trigger.
{{< /details >}}
 

### Split

This adds a two column side-by-side environment (will turn into 1 col for narrow devices):

##### Shortcode
```
{{ /* < columns > */ }}
This is column 1.
{{ /* < column > */ }}
This is column 2.
{{ /* < endcolumns > */ }}
```

##### Output
{{< columns >}}
This is column 1.
{{< column >}}
This is column 2.
{{< endcolumns >}}
