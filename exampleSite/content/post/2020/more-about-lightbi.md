## About

This is an adaptation of the [Beautiful Hugo](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) by [Michael Romero](https://github.com/halogenica). It supports most of the features of the original theme, and many new features. It has diverged from the original theme over time, with several updates.
