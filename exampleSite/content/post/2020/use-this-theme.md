In this post, we'll cover how to install Hugo and set up your first website with the Lightbi theme. For detailed steps, refer to [Hugo’s quick-start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).

1. **Create a New Hugo Site**
   ```bash
   hugo new site <name of site>
   cd <name of site>
   git init
   git submodule add https://github.com/binokochumolvarghese/lightbi-hugo themes/lightbi-hugo
   ```
- After completing the steps above, copy the contents of `exampleSite/contents` into the `content` folder of your website.
- Next, copy `hugo.toml` to the root folder of the website.
- Finally, run the following command.

    ```bash
      hugo server
    ```


2. **Preview Your Site**:   
Go to `http://localhost:1313/` to view your website in development mode. 

That’s it! You’re ready to start building.
