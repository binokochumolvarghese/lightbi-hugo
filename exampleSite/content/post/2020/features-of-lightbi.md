### Card based theme.
To customize the image placement within a card, the Lightbi theme offers four flexible options:

- Image at the top of the card
- Image in the middle of the card
- Image at the bottom of the card
- No image

To configure this, use the `previewCardImagePlacement` parameter in the `hugo.toml` file. Set it as follows:
- For the image at the top: `previewCardImagePlacement = "top"`
- For the image in the middle: `previewCardImagePlacement = "middle"`
- For the image at the bottom: `previewCardImagePlacement = "bottom"`
- For no image: `previewCardImagePlacement = "none"`

This gives you full control over how the image is displayed in the card layout.
