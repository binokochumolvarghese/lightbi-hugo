## Headings

To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (h3), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).
&nbsp;
# Heading level 1 	
## Heading level 2 	
### Heading level 3 
#### Heading level 4 
##### Heading level 5 
###### Heading level 6 	

## Paragraphs

To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet.

Markdown was developed in 2004 by John Gruber in collaboration with Aaron Swartz. Gruber wrote the first markdown-to-html converter in Perl, and it soon became widely used in websites. By 2014 there were dozens of implementations in many languages.

## Bold

To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

\*\*bold text**

## Italic

To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

\*Italic*

## Code

#### Inline Code

To create inline code, wrap with backticks ` . To create a code block, either indent each line by 4 spaces, or place 3 backticks ``` on a line above and below the code block. 

\`This is an inline code.`

#### Code Blocks

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
