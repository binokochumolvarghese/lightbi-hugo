### Card based theme.
To customize the image placement within a card, the Lightbi theme offers four flexible options:

- Image at the top of the card
- Image in the middle of the card
- Image at the bottom of the card
- No image

To configure this, use the `previewCardImagePlacement` parameter in the `hugo.toml` file. Set it as follows:
- For the image at the top: `previewCardImagePlacement = "top"`
- For the image in the middle: `previewCardImagePlacement = "middle"`
- For the image at the bottom: `previewCardImagePlacement = "bottom"`
- For no image: `previewCardImagePlacement = "none"`

This gives you full control over how the image is displayed in the card layout.

## Installation

Install Hugo and create a new site. See [the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) for details.

```
hugo new site <name of site>

git init
git submodule add https://github.com/binokochumolvarghese/lightbi-hugo themes/lightbi-hugo
echo "theme = 'lightbi-hugo'" >> hugo.toml
